# weather-wardrobe

This is an application I'm working on with a mentor.

I want it to:

- Fetch the current weather for a given location and display it to the user.
- I want to then use that data to recommend a t-shirt, light jacket or coat to the user.
- There will eventually be an auth flow so users can login and save their favourite locations.
- Eventually I'd like to have users set their own cold/medium/hot thresholds to account for the hot/cold-blooded among us.

I'll include instructions on how to run it when I've got something to show you :).
